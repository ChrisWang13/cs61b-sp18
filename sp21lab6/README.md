This lab is from cs61b sp21, which intends 
to introduce two methods to `persistence` in Java; 
1. Writing plain text to a file, 
2. Through serializing objects to a file
3. Static variables do NOT persist in Java between executions.When a program completes execution, all instance and static variables are completely lost.
